//Wiring
/*
- **STM32 Microcontroller**:
  - The `A1` pin is connected to the PWM signal pin of the SG90 Servo Motor.
  - The `5V` pin is connected to the power input of the servo motor.
  - The `G` (GND) pin is connected to the ground terminal of the servo motor.

- **SG90 Servo Motor**:
  - The red wire (`VCC`) is connected to the `5V` pin of the STM32.
  - The brown wire (`GND`) is connected to the `GND` pin of the STM32.
  - The orange wire (`PWM` signal) is connected to the `A1` pin of the STM32.

These connections allow the STM32 to control the angle of the servo motor by generating PWM signals.

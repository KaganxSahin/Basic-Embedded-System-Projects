- **STM32 Microcontroller**:
  - The `PA8` pin is connected to the signal pin of the active buzzer.
  - The `5V` pin is connected to the power input of the active buzzer.
  - The `G` (GND) pin is connected to the ground terminal of the active buzzer.

- **Buzzer**:
  - The `VCC` pin is connected to the `5V` pin of the STM32.
  - The `GND` pin is connected to the `GND` pin of the STM32.
  - The `I/O` pin is connected to the `PA8` pin of the STM32.

These connections allow the STM32 to control the buzzer by generating PWM signals.

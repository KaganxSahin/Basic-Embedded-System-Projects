//Wiring
/*
- **STM32 Microcontroller**:
  - The G pin is connected to the negative (ground) rail of the breadboard.
  - The A1 pin is connected to the positive terminal of a current-limiting resistor.
  - The other end of the resistor is connected to the anode (positive terminal) of the LED.
  - The cathode (negative terminal) of the LED is connected to the negative rail of the breadboard.

- **Breadboard Connections**:
  - The negative rail (ground) is connected to the G pin of the STM32.
  - The positive terminal of the current-limiting resistor is connected to the A1 pin of the STM32.
  - The cathode (negative terminal) of the LED is connected to the negative rail (ground) of the breadboard.

Resistor value can be anywhere between 100R - 330R.

//Wiring
/*
- **STM32 Microcontroller**:
  - The `A1` pin is connected to the middle terminal (analog output) of the potentiometer.
  - The `5V` pin is connected to the power input of the servo motor.
  - The `G` (GND) pin is connected to the ground terminals of both the potentiometer and the servo motor.

- **Potentiometer**:
  - One terminal is connected to `GND`, and the other terminal is connected to `3.3V`.
  - The middle terminal is connected to the `A1` pin of the STM32.

- **SG90 Servo Motor**:
  - The red wire (`VCC`) is connected to the `5V` pin of the STM32.
  - The brown wire (`GND`) is connected to the `GND` pin of the STM32.
  - The orange wire (`PWM` signal) is connected to a PWM output pin of the STM32.

These connections allow the potentiometer to control the angle of the servo motor.
